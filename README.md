# Hackathon_Enhanced-Weather-Reporting-for-Travel-Planning
This weather reporting/directions app provides for a means by which weather can be pulled after a given route has been defined so that users can see what to expect while plotting their trip.  The Weather Report site requires a registration/login process that is complete with lockout and Forgot Password functionality.  The registration process also sends an email confirmation prior to allowing new users to enter the features.  Once logged in, the site allows for a user to specify a Source and Destination and to then see the Distance/Duration, as well as the predicted route weather that they will encounter. A feature was also added using the foursquare API in order to pull popular events from the cities encountered along the way.  With the combination of the foursquare and wunderground weather API on top of the Google Maps API, this site allows for accurate weather forecasting, route planning, and go-to city events for anyone planning their travel.
